{b}RF Network Monitor Item
{n:netmon}
{ri:networkMonitorItem}
With the RF Network Monitor you can select a block and it will try
to find all blocks that use or produce RF which are connected
(directly or inderectly) to the selected block. It will also show
you how much RF is in each of the blocks and the coordinate. You
can use this item to help debug RF related network problems.
{}
Doubleclick on a line in the list of blocks will close the window and
the block will be hilighted for 5 seconds (configurable).
{}
{b}Machine Frame
{n:mframe}
{rb:machineFrame}
The machine frame is the base ingredient for all blocks in this mod.
{}
{b}RF Monitor
{n:rfmoni}
{rb:rfMonitorBlock}
The RF Monitor is a block that you place in the world and that
can examine a nearby (3x3x3 area around the monitor) block and
gives a visual indication of how much RF is left in that block.
This block can also give out redstone signals in case the RF in
the monitored block is too low or too high. You can use this
redstone signal with the Power Relay (see below) to control
parts of your RF network.
{}
{b}Storage Scanner
{n:stomon}
{rb:storageScannerBlock}
The Storage Scanner is a block that can scan the surrounding
area for inventories (chests, furnaces, other devices, basically
anything that can hold items) and show them in a list. You can
then select an inventory in that list and it will display the
contents of that inventory. Scanning the environment uses energy
and can take a while if you select a big radius. It also uses
RF to perform this scan.
{}
If you open the user interface of this scanner you get two lists.
The top list is initially empty but will be filled when you press
the 'Scan' button. It contains all the inventories (chests, furnaces
and so on) that it could find in the selected area. If you
previously scanned an area you don't have to do it again. If a line
shows 'REMOVED' that means the specific block was removed after
the scan.

If you select an inventory in the top list then the bottom list will
show the contents of that inventory.

Doubleclick on an inventory in the top list will close this
window and hilight it in the world for 5 seconds (by default).
{}
You can search for items in all inventories that it scanned. It will
mark all the inventories where it found an item that matches what
you typed with a yellow color. This gives you an easy way to find
out where you put that diamond pickaxe again.

The slider next to the 'Scan' button allows you to select the radius
that this machine will use to scan the area. A value of '4' means
that an area of 9x9x9 will be scanned. Note that this operation can
take a while.
{}
{b}Automatic Crafter
{n:crafte}
{rb:crafterBlock1}
The Crafter is a powerful automatic crafting machine that can handle
up to eight different recipes in a single block. It can be used to
craft multiple items independent from each other or else it can be
used for more complicated multi-step crafting recipes. By default it
uses 100 RF for every crafting cycle (where it does all crafting
operations in one step).
{}
The list at the top-left allows you to select all the supported
recipes. If you select a recipe you can edit it in the right grid
by dragging over the right items.

The crafter also has an internal inventory and four output slots
for crafting results.
{}
The 'Keep/All' button is only active when a recipe is selected and
allows you to control if this recipe will always keep at least a single
item in the internal inventory.

The 'Int/Ext' button is also only active when a recipe is selected
and allows you to control where the result of the crafting operation
of this recipe goes too. With 'Ext' (default) the result is put in
an output slot where it can be extracted by an external pipe.
With 'Int' the result goes in the internal inventory where it
can be used by other recipes in this crafter.

The crafter also has a redstone mode (button below which can be set
to 'ignore', 'off', or 'on') and it also has a speed mode which is set
to slow by default. Fast mode uses more energy.
{}
{b}RF Power Relay
{n:prelay}
{rb:relayBlock}
The Power Relay allows you to control how much RF to output based on a
redstone signal. In its GUI you can set the amount of RF/tick to give
in case redstone signal is off and also in case redstone signal is on.
Typically you would use 0 in case the redstone signal is off and some
other value in case the redstone signal is on. You can use this in
combination with the RF Monitor to turn off a portion of your RF network
in case power is low. For example, to turn off ore processing machines.
{}
{b}Teleporting System
{n:telepo}
RFTools supports a teleportation system that uses RF to do the
transfer of matter. A teleporter is essentially one-directional and
consists of a transmitter and a receiver. So you need a pair for
two-way teleportation. To connect a transmitter and a receiver you
will also need a dialing device.

Energy cost of teleportation depends on the distance traveled. Also
travelling to another dimension is a lot more expensive.

If you're an admin and want to troubleshoot the portal network
you can use the Teleport Probe item (has no recipe). You can use
this item to check for problems with all receivers in the world.
Doubleclick on an item in the list will teleport you without using RF.
{}
{b}Teleportation Blocks

{l:tptransmitter}Matter Transmitter
{l:tpreceiver}Matter Receiver
{l:tpdialer}Dialing Device
{l:tpdestcheck}Destination Analyzer
{l:tpaccess}Access Control
{}
{b}Matter Transmitter
{n:tptransmitter}
{rb:matterTransmitterBlock}
The matter transmitter is placed on the ground and (when dialed to a
valid destination) will teleport a player that is standing on it. There
is a fixed energy cost which is consumed immediatelly when the player
stands on it. Then during the duration of the teleport (witch varies
depending on the traveled distance) power is also consumed. If there
is not sufficient power during the first power usage then teleportation
will simply not start. But if there is a power failure during transit
then potentially very bad things can happen to the player.
{}
{b}Matter Receiver
{n:tpreceiver}
{rb:matterReceiverBlock}
The matter receiver is also placed on the ground. Players that teleport
to a receiver will appear on top of this block. Note that a receiver needs
energy. If the receiver doesn't have enough energy then teleportation will
go on but bad things will happen as soon as the player arrives at this
destination. So be careful!

If you give the matter receiver a name (using the GUI) then that name will
be shown in the dialing device which makes it easier to recognize.
{}
{b}Dialing Device
{n:tpdialer}
{rb:dialingDeviceBlock}
The dialing device is an important block which is needed to connect
nearby matter transmitters to receivers anywhere in the world. It shows
a list of all transmitters in the vicinity (by default an area of 21x11x21).
It also shows a list of all receivers in the world. Note that a dialed
transmitter will consume a little bit of energy while it is holding its
connection.

The 'Check' button is disabled by default unless you have a destination
analyzer connected to this machine (see below).
{}
{b}Destination Analyzer
{n:tpdestcheck}
{rb:destinationAnalyzerBlock}
This is a passive block that you can place next to a dialing device.
It enables the dialing device to check the status of a receiver. This way
you can be sure that a receiver has enough power or is not blocked
before attempting to make a connection.

In the future you will also be able to place destination analyzers next
to matter transmitters allowing them to warn you before entering the
teleportation beam.
{}
{b}Access Control
{n:tpaccess}
This is not implemented yet but in the future you will be able to control
who has access to a transmitter or receiver and you will also be able
to give out keys to other players so that they can access parts of
your network.
