{b}RF Network Monitor Item
{n:netmon}
{ri:networkMonitorItem}
With the RF Network Monitor you can select a block and it will try
to find all blocks that use or produce RF which are connected
(directly or inderectly) to the selected block. It will also show
you how much RF is in each of the blocks and the coordinate. You
can use this item to help debug RF related network problems.
{}
Doubleclick on a line in the list of blocks will close the window and
the block will be hilighted for 5 seconds (configurable).

{b}Machine Frame
{n:mframe}
{rb:machineFrame}
The machine frame is the base ingredient for all blocks in this mod.

{b}RF Monitor
{n:rfmoni}
{rb:rfMonitorBlock}
The RF Monitor is a block that you place in the world and that
can examine a nearby (3x3x3 area around the monitor) block and give
a visual indication of how much RF is left in that block. This
block can also give out redstone signals in case the RF in the
monitored block is too low or too high. You can use this
redstone signal with the Power Relay (see below) to control
parts of your RF network.
