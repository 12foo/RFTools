{b}Introduction
{n:intro}
Always wanted to create your own worlds? Explore uncharted areas and
create magnificent buildings in fabulous worlds? With the Dimension
Builder you create your own dimensions with all kinds of special
features. Make void worlds, mining ages, floating islands, ...

There is one catch though. Dimensions require power to run (RF). Simple
dimensions like a void age don't require a lot of power (10-200 RF/tick)
but very complex dimensions can easily go above millions RF/tick. So if
you want a world made out of diamond blocks you're either going to have
to be very lucky or else be prepared for a hefty power generation system.

RFTools generates dimensions with random features you can make things
more deterministic by specifying every type of dimlet.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Unknown Dimlets
{n:unknown}
You don't need any dimlets to create a dimension. You can just specify
no dimlets and generate a totally random world. Maybe you get lucky?

However, to have any kind of control you will need dimlets. Scattered
throughout the world, in dungeons and other chests, you have a chance
of finding 'unknown dimlets'. These small items were made a long time
ago with long forgotten technology. There is also a small chance that
you can get an unknown dimlet from killing an enderman. However, the
best place to find dimlets is in RFTools dimensions. You could go
ahead, create a random dimension and go find an RFTools dungeon.

What do you do with these unknown dimlets? You put them in the
'Dimlet Researcher' machine.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimensional Shards
{n:shards}
Some items and machines in RFTools require Dimensional Shards. This is
a special material that you can only find in RFTools dimensions (below
level 40). The best way to get this is to make a random dimension, hope
there is some stone there (or else make a 'Flat Terrain' dimlet and be
sure of a flat world) and go mine some with a fortune pickaxe. Or you
can just melt the ore if you picked it up using silk touch.

{b}Dimensional Shards have several uses:
    First you require dimensional shards to create the dimlet template item.
        And this item in turn is required to craft some of the basic dimlets.
    You also need some shards to craft the 'Machine Infuser' (more later).
    You also need some shards to craft the 'Activity Probe' (more later).
    And finally you can use them to 'infuse' almost all RFTools machines.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Machine Infuser
{n:infuser}
RFTools has the 'Machine Infuser' which is crafted as follows:
{rb:machineInfuserBlock}

With this machines you can inject dimensional shards into almost all other
RFTools machines. Just pick up any RFTools machine with a wrench and put
it in the machine. You can infuse up to 256 shards into a single machine.
Infused machines work more efficiently or faster. The benefits vary
depending on the machine but in almost all cases it will need a lot less
power to operate and in some cases speed will go up a lot.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
One particular use case is the Dimension Builder. A fully infused Dimension
Builder will create dimensions a lot faster and use less energy. But also
the shield block, auto crafter, and so on will benefit from this.

It is also very useful to infuse your Matter Transmitter and Matter
Receiver blocks as that way they will work faster and use a lot less
energy (making them safer to use).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlet Researcher
{n:researcher}
The Dimlet Researcher uses RF to examine your unknown dimlets, changing
them to a random knonwn dimlet. It is crafted as follows:
{rb:dimletResearcherBlock}

Note that some dimlets are more rare then others so it may take
a while for your dimlet of choice to appear.

Most dimlets can only be obtained this way as they cannot be crafted. There
are some exceptions. Some very basic and simple dimlets can be crafted.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
You may notice that some of these craftable dimlets require a
weird item. This is a Dimlet Template which can be crafted as
follows:
{ri:dimletTemplate}

To craft this you actually need dimensional shards.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}These are the current types of dimlets that you can find:
{n:types}

    Biome dimlets: these control what biomes you can have in a dimension.
        Note that at this moment you can only specify one biome.
        Specifying more biomes simply doesn't work (this is on the todo
        for later). If you don't specify a biome then you will just get the
        default biomes.
    Foliage dimlets: currently not implemented.
    Liquid dimlets: this is a modifier dimlet that can be used in
        combination with the Terrain dimlets and the Lake feature. It
        lets you control what kind of liquids will be used. If you use the
        'Liquid None Dimlet' then you just get the defaults (water and lava).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Material dimlets: this is a modifier dimlet that can be used in
        combination with the Terrain dimlets and some of the feature dimlets
        (canyons, tendrils, oregen, ...). If you use the 'Material None
        Dimlet' then you just get the defaults (stone).
    Mob dimlets: using these dimlets you can specify additional mobs that
        should spawn in your world (in addition to normal mob spawning!).
        If you use the 'Mob Default Dimlet' then you just get default mobs.
    Sky dimlets: with these dimlets you can control the color and light
        level of your sky.
    Time dimlets: with these dimlets you can control the time of the day.
        It can be set to either a fixed time (morning, evening, midnight,
        noon) or else you can get slow or faster time.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Structure dimlets: use these to control various structure generation
        (villages, nether fortresses, ...). If you specify the 'Structure
        None Dimlet' you don't get any structure like that.
    Feature dimlets: various features of world generation can be
        controlled with this. Like caves, tendrils, canyons, ... Use
        'Feature None Dimlet' if you don't want any special worldgen
        feature. Some of these features use liquid (in case of lake
        feature) or material (in case of tendril, canyon, oregen, ...
        features) modifiers.
    Terrain dimlets: these are used to control the overall form of the
        terrain. Void and flat are craftable but you can also get island,
        normal or amplified.
    Digit dimlets: use digit dimlets to make new unique worlds using exactly
        the same dimlets as another world you just created.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Special dimlets: these are special dimlets that are usually
        extremely rare.

{b}There are currently two special dimlets:

    Peaceful Dimlet: this dimlet prevents hostile mobs from
        spawning in your dimension (except for mobs that you
        manually add using mob dimlets). It is an expensive
        dimlet though and it will also never be randomly
        generated in dimensions that you create.
    Efficiency Dimlet: if you add this rare dimlet to your
        dimension tab then the dimension will consume 20% less
        energy per tick. This effect is cumulative.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlet Scrambler
{n:scrambler}
Sometimes you collect a lot of dimlets that you don't find particularly
useful. In that case the dimlet scrambler may be a useful machine for you.
You can craft it as follows:
{rb:dimletScramblerBlock}

This machine takes three dimlets (two should be non-craftable) of any type
and recyles their components to create a new random dimlet. In contrast
with the dimlet researcher this machine has a better chance of giving back
rare dimlets. This depends on the rarity of the dimlets that you scramble.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Enscriber
{n:enscriber}
This machine is where you actually describe your dimensions.
It is crafted as follows:
{rb:dimensionEnscriberBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To use it you first have to insert an Empty Dimension Tab which
is crafted as follows:
{ri:emptyDimensionTab}

This will be the item in which we will insert all dimlets and create a
'Realized Dimension Tab' that describes our dimension.

If you just want a random world then this is all you need to do. You can
just press 'Store' and pick a name for your dimension (input field at
the bottom-left) and you will get a totally random dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Otherwise, if you want a little bit more control you have to insert dimlets
in the top grid. The order of these dimlets matters. Modifier dimlets
(material and liquid) have to go before the dimlet that they affect. Unused
modifier dimlets are simply ignored. You can insert as many dimlets as you
want but note that not all combinations are useful (i.e. if you put in a
'Void' and 'Flat' terrain dimlet then only one will be used) and the cost
of the dimension is calculated from the dimlets that are inserted. Not from
the dimlets that are actually used! So inserting too many dimlets will make
your dimension more expensive.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you don't specify a certain type of dimlet then you will get a random
selection of that dimlet type. For example, if you don't specify any
structure dimlet then you might get a selection of random structures (like
village, nether fortress, ...). If you don't want that you have to insert
a 'Structure None Dimlet' which will prevent structures from being
generated. The same goes for many other dimlet types.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
An important thing to realize is that the dimlets that you insert into a
dimension tab makes the 'signature' of that dimension. That means that if
you create another dimension tab and insert exactly the same dimlets then
it will refer to exactly the same dimension. This can be handy in case
you want to power a dimension from multiple places (more on that in the
Dimension Builder section) which can be handy for very expensive
dimensions.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that with this dimension enscriber you can also deconstruct a realized
dimension tab into its original dimlets and the empty dimension tab. The
dimension will not be removed (if you created one) and can still be
accessed if you have a teleporter to it. However, it can no longer be
powered unless you have another realized dimension tab sitting in a
Dimension Builder somewhere. If you accidentally deconstructed a
realized dimension tab into its dimlets you can simply construct it
again and it will refer to the original dimension (without having to
build it again).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
This means that if you want to generate another dimension with exactly the
same features as before you will need to add some dimlets to change the
signature. The best way to do that is by using 'digit' dimlets. These
dimlets don't do anything special to the dimension but they do change
the signature allowing you to make multiple dimensions with identical
features (although randomly generated features may and will differ if
you didn't specify them).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that when you make a realized dimension tab you can see how much
RF/tick will be consumed by this dimension when it made. But be aware
that random features that are selected during creation of the dimension
will also contribute for 10%. So if you got 'lucky' and get a diamond
block world randomly (you didn't specify a diamond block) then the
RF/tick will still be increased by 10% of the cost of the diamond block
dimlet. This is a serious discount but this can still make the dimension
unusable for you. If that's the case, just extract the dimension tab
again and make a new dimension (put in some digit dimlets to make a new
unique dimension) and hope the next world will not be as expensive.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Builder
{n:builder}
The Dimension Builder is the device that you need to actually create
dimensions. It can be crafted as follows:
{rb:dimensionBuilderBlock}

Depending on the complexity of the dimension it will use power and need
some time to actually construct the dimension. If there is not enough
power present the building will be delayed. You can also take out your
dimension tab if you want to temporarily stop building the dimension (if
you need power for something else for example). The dimension tab will
remember the current progress.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
As soon as the dimension is ready the tooltip on the dimension tab
will change indicating the status and current power. You will also
notice that the energy level of the dimension builder is suddenly
emptied. That's because all current energy in the dimension builder
is immediately given to the dimension. The dimension itself has a
buffer of 40000000 RF. Don't attempt to go to your dimension if
there is not yet enough energy in it. Wait until sufficient energy
has been put in it (you can see the current level in the tooltip
of the dimension tab).

Hint: if you shift-right click with the dimension tab in your hand
you can see what random features were selected for creating this
dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note on powering very expensive dimensions: the dimension builder
accepts maximum 50000 RF/tick on every side. So at most it can
get 300000 RF/tick if you input energy from all six sides and if
you have conduits or energy cells that can handle that amount of
RF/tick (a tesseract would work). Sometimes even 300000 RF/tick
is not enough to power your dimension. In that case you can use
multiple dimension builders and multiple (identical) dimension tabs.
That does mean that you will need multiples of all the dimlets that
you used to create that dimension tab as well.

Hint: the Special Efficiency Dimlet helps with reducing power usage.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Getting there and Safety
{n:teleport}

Once you get your first dimension you will need a way to get there. To do
that you have to use the RFTools teleportation system. At the time the
dimension is created the Dimension Builder also generated a spawn platform
with a Matter Receiver in the middle. This matter receiver will be fully
charged so it is safe to teleport there.

So after creating the dimension you will need a Dialing Device to dial a matter
transmitter to that new destination. If you gave your realized dimension tab a
name (in the enscriber) then that destination will also be named like that.

But don't just teleport to there yet! There are a few things you should
worry about:
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Power!
Your Dimension Builder is feeding power into the dimension. As
long as that builder is chunkloaded or you are near it all is fine.
But as soon as you teleport to that other dimension the dimension
builder may become unloaded at which point no new energy will be
entered in the dimension. The dimension will from that point on
run on internal power. Depending on how expensive the dimension is
you can live in a non-powered dimension for a considerable time.
But beware of power running out! You will die if power is completely
gone but before that happens the dimension will darken and you will
get various bad effects.

Also note that if you have a dimension that uses a lot of RF/tick
this internal buffer will go down a lot faster.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To solve this problem you either have to make sure your dimension
builder is chunkloader or else take with you another dimension
builder with a copy (or the original) realized dimension tab and
some power (a battery or generator) so that you can keep sending
power from inside the dimension itself.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Getting Back

While the Dimension Builder generates a Matter Receiver in the dimension
there will not be a Matter Transmitter! So you have to bring your own way
back with you. You can do this with various teleportation systems but the
recommended way is to use a Matter Transmitter that you bring with you.
There are two options:

Put the matter transmitter in your main base, make it fully powered and dial
it to a matter receiver also in your base. Then pick it up with a wrench. It
will keep the settings and when you put it down in the other dimension it
will have power and you will be able to get back with it. Keep in mind that
power in that transmitter goes down a lot so you will have to be careful
next time you go in the dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Best is to bring along a battery or generator as well.
Otherwise take some power, the matter transmitter and another
dialing device with you and simply set up a teleportation hub in
the dimension. If all fails you can simply go back by dieing. You
will return at your spawn point (but without inventory of course).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you are in the dimension then there is one handy tool that you
can bring with you to monitor the power status of the dimension
and that's the Dimension Monitor that you can craft like this:
{ri:dimensionMonitorItem}

Right clicking with this tool will show you the amount of power
still left in the dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Activity Probe
{n:probe}

Normally dimensions use power constantly. Even when nobody is in
them. It is possible to make this a bit more efficient by making
an Activity Probe. You can craft this block as follows:
{rb:activityProbeBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
This device is passive. It doesn't use any power and it has no user
interface either. You simply place it in an RFTools dimension (it
has no effect in any other dimension). While it is present in a
dimension it monitors activity in that dimension and it will shut
down power consumption from that dimension when nobody is in the
dimension (including chunk loaders). So this block is an effective
way to make sure your dimension isn't using power needlessly.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Editor
{n:editor}

With the Dimension Editor you can alter already created dimensions
by inserting some types of dimlets. It can be crafted as follows:
{rb:dimensionEditorBlock}

Note that inserted dimlets are lost during this process (you will not get
it back even if you deconstruct the dimension tab) and you pay the full
power cost for it. There is no way to undo this so be careful. This can
only be done with dimlets of type 'special', 'mob', 'effect',
'sky', and 'time'.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
