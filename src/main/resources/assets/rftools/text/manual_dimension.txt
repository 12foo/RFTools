{b}Introduction to Dimension Building
{n:intro}
Always wanted to create your own worlds? Explore uncharted areas and
create magnificent buildings in fabulous worlds? With the Dimension
Builder you create your own dimensions with all kinds of special
features. Make void worlds, mining ages, floating islands, ...

There is one catch, though. Dimensions require power to run (RF). Simple
dimensions like a void world don't require a lot of power (10-200 RF/tick)
but very complex dimensions can easily go above millions RF/tick. So if
you want a world made out of diamond blocks you're either going to have
to be very lucky or else be prepared for a hefty power generation system.

RFTools generates dimensions with random features you can make things
more deterministic by specifying every type of dimlet.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Theory
{n:theory}
Before embarking on the adventure of forming your own worlds, it is
important to understand how the dimensions work.

The first thing that is important to understand is that worlds you
create are not necessarily unique. If a pattern of code is used to
create one world, using the same pattern of code will create the
same world again. In fact, when you enter the first world and make
changes, the changes will appear in the second as well!

This allows you to disassemble dimensions, but enter the same exact
ones later with the changes you've made still there, provided
you used the exact same code.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlets - Coding the World
{n:unknown}
Dimensions, when created normally, will be completely random. You have
no way of knowing whether it will be a floating sky world or a huge
cave, or whether it's midnight or mid-day. Although you have a chance
of creating a good world, chances are it won't work out in your favour.

However, you can control your world with objects called Dimlets.
Scattered throughout the world, in dungeons and other chests, or just
obtained by killing Endermen, you have a chance of finding 'Unknown
Dimlets.' These small items were made a long time ago with forgotten
technology. These dimlets are similar to code - imagine each dimlet
as it's own line of code. Modifying the next dimlet or defining
something about the world.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Dimlets are complicated devices, filled with advanced circuitry
and powerful essences. These things can literally define how a
world works. Most of the work you will be doing with dimensions
will involve these dimlets.

If you ever find yourself running low on dimlets, there is a
higher chance of finding them within your custom dimensions.
So, when nearly out of dimlets, create a couple random worlds
and look around for interesting structures - you may find some
very valuable dimlets in there.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}There are currently 12 types of dimlets that have been discovered:
    Terrain Dimlets: These are used to define what a world looks
        like. Some examples include a normal world, a flat world,
        or a skylands world.
    Digit Dimlets: Digit Dimlets are lines of code that can be used
        to create different dimensions. This allows you to create
        new, unique worlds, except with exactly the same dimlets.
    Biome Dimlets: These control what biomes appear in a dimension.
        How many biomes are supported depends on the controller.
    Biome Controller: These Determine how many and which type of 
        Biomes are selected. For instance, you could define it
        so that there is only one biome, or a checkerboard of
        biomes.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Material Dimlets: These dimlets are used to define what a feature is
        made out of. For instance, these can be used to make sure a world
        is made out of Glowstone or a tendril is made out of Netherrack.
        When used as a modifier for a another dimlet, the cost of
        these dimlets will drastically increase, same as the liquid
        dimlets.
    Liquid Dimlets: Similar to Material Dimlets, these only differ in
        the fact that they define a liquid instead of a solid material.
    Feature Dimlets: These dimlets define what features appear in the
        world, such as floating ores filled with liquids, increased
        ore generation, or even tendrils of various substances.
    Structure Dimlets: These define if certain structures will appear in
        the world, such as strongholds, villages, or Mineshafts.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Mob dimlets: using these dimlets you can specify additional mobs that
        should spawn in your world (in addition to normal mob spawning!).
    Sky Dimlets: These allow you to define the colours, sizes, or even
        existance of various objects in the sky, such as planets, moons,
        suns, sky colour, fog colour, and more.
    Time dimlets: with these dimlets you can control the time of the day.
        It can be set to either a fixed time (morning, evening, midnight,
        noon) or else you can get slow or faster time.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Special dimlets: these are special dimlets that are usually
        extremely rare.

{b}There are currently five special dimlets:

    Peaceful Dimlet: This dimlet prevents hostile mobs from
        spawning in your dimension (except for mobs that you
        manually add using mob dimlets). It is an expensive
        dimlet though and it will also never be randomly
        generated in dimensions that you create.
    Efficiency Dimlet: If you add this rare dimlet to your
        dimension tab then the dimension will consume 20% less
        energy per tick. This effect is cumulative. However,
        it will add a much increased creation time and
        creation cost.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
    Mediocre Efficiency Dimlet: This dimlet functions as a
        somewhat inferior version of the Effeciency Dimlet.
        It is easier to obtain, but does not add quite the
        effects the normal Effeciency Dimlet does.
    Shelter Dimlet: A dimlet for dimensions that may be
        excessively hostile, this dimlet creates a much
        safer spot for teleporting in.
    Seed Dimlet: A very specialized dimlet to control the seed
        of the random world generation for a dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlet Researcher - Revealing your Dimlets
{n:researcher}
Now that you know what each type of dimlets do, the next step will be to
determine what type your Unknown Dimlets are. For that, you'll need
a Dimlet Researcher.
{rb:dimletResearcherBlock}

Simply place the Unknown Dimlet into the slot on the left, and, when it
is provided with power, it will be turned into a usable dimlet on the
right.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Certain dimlets are more valuable and rare than others, so it is likely
you will not obtain the dimlet you want right away. Just keep on
researching, and you'll find this way.

Most dimlets require you to research them or use another machine to
find them, but certain simpler dimlets can be easily crafted in any
table.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Enscriber
{n:enscriber}
This machine is where you actually describe your dimensions.
It is crafted as follows:
{rb:dimensionEnscriberBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To use it you first have to insert an Empty Dimension Tab which
is crafted as follows:
{ri:emptyDimensionTab}

This will be the item in which we will insert all dimlets and create a
'Realized Dimension Tab' that describes our dimension.

If you just want a random world then this is all you need to do. You can
just press 'Store' and pick a name for your dimension (input field at
the bottom-left) and you will get a totally random dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Otherwise, if you want a little bit more control you have to insert dimlets
in the top grid. The order of these dimlets matters. Modifier dimlets
(material and liquid) have to go before the dimlet that they affect. Unused
modifier dimlets are simply ignored. You can insert as many dimlets as you
want but note that not all combinations are useful (i.e. if you put in a
'Void' and 'Flat' terrain dimlet then only one will be used) and the cost
of the dimension is calculated from the dimlets that are inserted. Not from
the dimlets that are actually used! So inserting too many dimlets will make
your dimension more expensive.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you don't specify a certain type of dimlet then you will get a random
selection of that dimlet type. For example, if you don't specify any
structure dimlet then you might get a selection of random structures (like
village, nether fortress, ...). If you don't want that you have to insert
a 'Structure None Dimlet' which will prevent structures from being
generated. The same goes for many other dimlet types.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
An important thing to realize is that the dimlets that you insert into a
dimension tab makes the 'signature' of that dimension. That means that if
you create another dimension tab and insert exactly the same dimlets then
it will refer to exactly the same dimension. This can be handy in case
you want to power a dimension from multiple places (more on that in the
Dimension Builder section) which can be handy for very expensive
dimensions.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that with this dimension enscriber you can also deconstruct a realized
dimension tab into its original dimlets and the empty dimension tab. The
dimension will not be removed (if you created one) and can still be
accessed if you have a teleporter to it. However, it can no longer be
powered unless you have another realized dimension tab sitting in a
Dimension Builder somewhere. If you accidentally deconstructed a
realized dimension tab into its dimlets you can simply construct it
again and it will refer to the original dimension (without having to
build it again).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
This means that if you want to generate another dimension with exactly the
same features as before you will need to add some dimlets to change the
signature. The best way to do that is by using 'digit' dimlets. These
dimlets don't do anything special to the dimension but they do change
the signature allowing you to make multiple dimensions with identical
features (although randomly generated features may and will differ if
you didn't specify them).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note that when you make a realized dimension tab you can see how much
RF/tick will be consumed by this dimension when it made. But be aware
that random features that are selected during creation of the dimension
will also contribute for 10%. So if you got 'lucky' and get a diamond
block world randomly (you didn't specify a diamond block) then the
RF/tick will still be increased by 10% of the cost of the diamond block
dimlet. This is a serious discount but this can still make the dimension
unusable for you. If that's the case, just extract the dimension tab
again and make a new dimension (put in some digit dimlets to make a new
unique dimension) and hope the next world will not be as expensive.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Builder
{n:builder}
The Dimension Builder is the device that you need to actually create
dimensions. It can be crafted as follows:
{rb:dimensionBuilderBlock}

Depending on the complexity of the dimension it will use power and need
some time to actually construct the dimension. If there is not enough
power present the building will be delayed. You can also take out your
dimension tab if you want to temporarily stop building the dimension (if
you need power for something else for example). The dimension tab will
remember the current progress.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
As soon as the dimension is ready the tooltip on the dimension tab
will change indicating the status and current power. You will also
notice that the energy level of the dimension builder is suddenly
emptied. That's because all current energy in the dimension builder
is immediately given to the dimension. The dimension itself has a
buffer of 40000000 RF. Don't attempt to go to your dimension if
there is not yet enough energy in it. Wait until sufficient energy
has been put in it (you can see the current level in the tooltip
of the dimension tab).

Hint: if you shift-right click with the dimension tab in your hand
you can see what random features were selected for creating this
dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Note on powering very expensive dimensions: the dimension builder
accepts maximum 50000 RF/tick on every side. So at most it can
get 300000 RF/tick if you input energy from all six sides and if
you have conduits or energy cells that can handle that amount of
RF/tick (a tesseract would work). Sometimes even 300000 RF/tick
is not enough to power your dimension. In that case you can use
multiple dimension builders and multiple (identical) dimension tabs.
That does mean that you will need multiples of all the dimlets that
you used to create that dimension tab as well.

Hint: the Special Efficiency Dimlet and the Mediocre Effeciency
Dimlet both help with reducing maintanence cost, but will add a
greater creation cost and tick cost.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Getting there and Safety
{n:teleport}

Once you get your first dimension you will need a way to get there. To do
that you have to use the RFTools teleportation system. At the time the
dimension is created the Dimension Builder also generated a spawn platform
with a Matter Receiver in the middle. This matter receiver will be fully
charged so it is safe to teleport there.

So after creating the dimension you will need a Dialing Device to dial a matter
transmitter to that new destination. If you gave your realized dimension tab a
name (in the enscriber) then that destination will also be named like that.

But don't just teleport to there yet! There are a few things you should
worry about:
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Power!
Your Dimension Builder is feeding power into the dimension. As
long as that builder is chunkloaded or you are near it all is fine.
But as soon as you teleport to that other dimension the dimension
builder may become unloaded at which point no new energy will be
entered in the dimension. The dimension will from that point on
run on internal power. Depending on how expensive the dimension is
you can live in a non-powered dimension for a considerable time.
But beware of power running out! You will die if power is completely
gone but before that happens the dimension will darken and you will
get various bad effects.

Also note that if you have a dimension that uses a lot of RF/tick
this internal buffer will go down a lot faster.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To solve this problem you either have to make sure your dimension
builder is chunkloader or else take with you another dimension
builder with a copy (or the original) realized dimension tab and
some power (a battery or generator) so that you can keep sending
power from inside the dimension itself.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Getting Back

While the Dimension Builder generates a Matter Receiver in the dimension
there will not be a Matter Transmitter! So you have to bring your own way
back with you. You can do this with various teleportation systems but the
recommended way is to use a Matter Transmitter that you bring with you.
There are two options:

Put the matter transmitter in your main base, fully power it and dial
it to a nearby matter receiver. Then pick it up with a wrench. It
will keep the settings so when you put it down in the other dimension it
will still have power and you will be able to get back with it. Keep in mind 
that power in that transmitter is drained with every teleport, so you will 
have to be careful next time you go into the dimension.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Best is to bring along a battery or generator as well.
Otherwise take some power, the matter transmitter and another
dialing device with you and simply set up a teleportation hub in
the dimension. If all fails you can simply go back by dieing. You
will return at your spawn point (but without inventory of course).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you are in the dimension then there is one handy tool that you
can bring with you to monitor the power status of the dimension
and that's the Dimension Monitor that you can craft like this:
{ri:dimensionMonitorItem}

Right clicking with this tool will show you the amount of power
still left in the dimension. The tool also gives a visual indication
of the current amount of power.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimensional Shards
{n:shards}
Certain machines and items require an odd essence called "Dimensional
Shards." Probably produced as a byproduct of the energy fueled into
these dimensions. Generating below level 40, these shards will appear
in any RFTools Dimension. This ore can be mined with a pickaxe to
return the shards, which can then be used for all manner of things.

{b}Dimensional Shards have several uses:
    Firstly, shards required to craft some of the basic dimlets.
    You also need some shards to craft the 'Machine Infuser,' 'Activity
    Probe', and 'Dimlet Templates.'
    And finally you can use them to 'infuse' almost all RFTools machines to
    make them more effecient or give them special abilities.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Machine Infuser
{n:infuser}
RFTools has the 'Machine Infuser' which is crafted as follows:
{rb:machineInfuserBlock}

With this machines you can inject dimensional shards into almost all other
RFTools machines. Just pick up any RFTools machine with a wrench and put
it in the left slot of the machine. You can infuse up to 256 shards into a 
single machine. Infused machines work more efficiently or faster. The benefits 
vary depending on the machine but in almost all cases it will need a lot less
power to operate and in some cases speed will go up a lot.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
One particular use case is the Dimension Builder. A fully infused Dimension
Builder will create dimensions a lot faster and use less energy. But also
the shield block, auto crafter, and so on will benefit from this.

It is also very useful to infuse your Matter Transmitter and Matter
Receiver blocks as that way they will work faster and use a lot less
energy (making them safer to use).
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlet Scrambler
{n:scrambler}
Sometimes you collect a lot of dimlets that you don't find particularly
useful. In that case the dimlet scrambler may be a useful machine for you.
You can craft it as follows:
{rb:dimletScramblerBlock}

This machine takes three dimlets (two should be non-craftable) of any type
and recyles their components to create a new random dimlet. In contrast
with the dimlet researcher this machine has a better chance of giving back
rare dimlets. This depends on the rarity of the dimlets that you scramble.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
You may notice that some of these craftable dimlets require a
weird item. This is a Dimlet Template which can be crafted as
follows:
{ri:dimletTemplate}

To craft this you actually need dimensional shards.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Activity Probe
{n:probe}

Normally dimensions use power constantly. Even when nobody is in
them. It is possible to make this a bit more efficient by making
an Activity Probe. You can craft this block as follows:
{rb:activityProbeBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
This device is passive. It doesn't use any power and it has no user
interface either. You simply place it in an RFTools dimension (it
has no effect in any other dimension). While it is present in a
dimension it monitors activity in that dimension and it will shut
down power consumption from that dimension when nobody is in the
dimension (including chunk loaders). So this block is an effective
way to make sure your dimension isn't using power needlessly.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Editor
{n:editor}

With the Dimension Editor you can alter already created dimensions
by inserting some types of dimlets. It can be crafted as follows:
{rb:dimensionEditorBlock}

Note that inserted dimlets are lost during this process (you will not get
it back even if you deconstruct the dimension tab) and you pay the full
power cost for it. There is no way to undo this so be careful. This can
only be done with dimlets of type 'special', 'mob', 'effect',
'sky', and 'time'.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimension Monitor
{n:monitor}

Besides the dimension monitor item there is also a dimension monitor
block which sends out a redstone signal as soon as the power in
the current dimension goes below a certain level. It can be
crafted as follows:
{rb:dimensionMonitorBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Dimlet Crafting
{n:create}

Dimlet Crafting is a subject for the experienced dimension builder.
Using the Dimlet Workbench you can deconstruct dimlets into their
technical components and then reconstruct them into new dimlets.

The workbench can be crafted as follows:
{rb:dimletWorkbenchBlock}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
Every dimlet is made out of six parts:
    - Dimlet Base item
    - Dimlet Control Circuit
    - Dimlet Energy Module
    - Dimlet Memory Module
    - Dimlet Type Controller
    - Essence item

You need the right tier of every part to make a dimlet.
There is one control circuit for every rarity (0 to 6) and there
are three levels of the energy and memory modules.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
When extracting dimlets into parts there is a 40% chance for
every part that you get nothing. To avoid this it is recommended
that you infuse the workbench. A maximum infused workbench will
guarantee that you get all parts back.

Extracting a dimlet will never give you an essence item. You
always have to make that.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
There are various kinds of essence items depending on the type
of dimlet that you want to make:
    - Biome Absorber for biome dimlets
    - Material Absorber for material dimlets
    - Liquid Absorber for liquid dimlets
    - Syringe for mob dimlets
    - Peaceful essence (made out of 9 filled syringes of a
      specific type) for the peaceful dimlet
So, if you wanted to create a Biome: Forest dimlet, you would
place the Biome Absorber within a Forest Biome. Slowly, the
Biome Absorber will fill up with the essence of the Forest Biome.
You can then place it in the last slot of the Dimlet Workbench
along with the other pieces of the dimlet to build your Biome:
Forest dimlet, now ready to be used in any dimensions!
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
