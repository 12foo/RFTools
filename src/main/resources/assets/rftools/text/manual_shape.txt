{b}Shield System
{n:shield}
RFTools implements a 'simple' shield system that can filter mobs, animals,
players, and items. You start by building the shape of your shield with
connected Shield Template Blocks of the same color. Then you put a Shield
Block next to one of these templates and you give it power.

A tier 1 shield can handle 256 blocks. Tier 2 ups this to 1024. The tier 3
ups this to 4096 and deals 4 times as much damage at twice the power.

To compose the shield right click the shield block with a wrench. The
shield block will compose the shield in the specified shape. If you hit
the shield with left click it will also connect on corners. Wrench the
shield again to get the template blocks back. By doing that you
can change the shape of your shield in case you're not happy with it.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To craft the Shield Template Blocks you use the following recipe:
{rb:shield_template_block}

Note that there are four different template blocks so you can use them
to make adjacent distinct shields. Every projector will only take one color.

To craft the Shield Block you use the following recipe:
{rb:shield_block1}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The shield has five visualization options:
    Invisible: the shield is totally invisible
    Shield: a transparent generic shield texture is used
    Solid: the shield is solid
    Transparent: the shield is transparent
    Mimic: the shield mimics some block

In the gui you can also insert rules for different types of
entities. For every rule you have the following actions:
    Pass: entity can pass through
    Solid: entity is blocked
    Damage: entity gets damage
    SolDmg: entity is blocked and gets damage
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
You can also set the type of damage. By default the damage will be
'generic' but you can also set it to 'player'. This will consume
more energy but you will get XP orbs as well as loot that you
normally only get when a mob is killed by the player (tip: the
Builder can collect XP orbs as well as items in some area).

If you select 'player' damage then you can also enable looting by
inserting dimensional shards. These are used up for every looting kill.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
If you hit the shield projector with your left mouse instead of the right
mouse it will also scan on the corners for template blocks. Additionally
using the smart wrench it is possible to add or remove shield templates
to an already formed shield. Note that doing this will not be remembered
if you decompose the shield again.

Note that the shield also supports shape cards. In that case you don't
have to use shield template blocks but instead you can insert the
appropriate shape card to define the shape of the shield. More on this
in the shape card section.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Builder
{n:builder}
{rb:builder}
The Builder is one of the most versatile machines in RFTools. It can:
    - Move a structure from one spot (even other dimension) to another
    - Rebuild a structure from one spot to another
    - Swap structures between two spots
    - Build geometrical shapes (dome, torus, box, ...)
    - Clear out areas in a certain shape (void blocks)
    - Quarry an area in a certain shape (silk touch, fortune, ...)
    - Collect items and XP in an area
    - Pump and place liquids
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
A chest or tank on top or below is sometimes needed to supply or collect.
Using the GUI you can control where the builder should place the blocks
(always at the back of the builder).

Other GUI options are:
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,160,48,Silent mode: mute sounds from moving blocks}
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,96,48,Support mode: create preview/support blocks}
Help to identify what will happen and help with gravity affected blocks.
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,128,48,Entity mode: also move entities}
{i:textures/gui/guielements.png,192,48,Loop mode:}
In this mode the builder will keep running as long as it has a redstone
signal and keep on moving or copying if there is room to do so. If
this is off the builder will do one pass and stop.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
To work the Builder always requires either a space card (with an
associated space chamber) or else a shape card. More on those later.

Space cards are required for item/XP collection. Entity movement
and some forms of area building/swapping/moving. The other functionalities
(like pumping and placing liquids, quarrying, voiding and building) require
a shape card.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The builder also supports a standard RFTools filter. If that filter is
inserted then it will only quarry or void blocks that match the filter.
Note that this works only on the block in the world, not the end result
of the block. i.e. to filter on diamonds you need to insert the diamond
ore block in the filter. All filter options like whitelist/blacklist
and filter by mod are supported.

In addition the Builder also has a redstone control option.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
For moving, swapping and copying structures you need a space card
linked to a space chamber.

You can use Space Chamber blocks to mark the corners of the source
area that you want to work. One of these corners should be a
Space Chamber Controller block.
{rb:space_chamber}
{rb:space_chamber_controller}
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{n:chambercard}
{ri:space_chamber_card}
Right selecting the controller block with a wrench will let it form the
chamber. If all is correct you will get a message saying so. Then you need
to use a Space Chamber Card (right click it on the controller) to link the
controller to the card.

Put that card in the builder, set the right mode and other
parameters and give it a redstone signal.

If you right click a linked space chamber card it will give you an overview
of all blocks and entities together with the cost of moving them.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
For building geometrical shapes, voiding and quarrying areas you
need shape cards:
{ri:shape_card}

Right clicking such a card will open a GUI where you can set the shape as
well as the dimensions. A shape card can be upgraded in the crafting table
to make the void card and one of the quarry cards.

Note that several options in the GUI of the builder are unused if you use
shape cards.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Shape cards
{n:shapecard}
{ri:shape_card}

The Shape Card is a simple item but there are a lot of powerful things you
can do with it. Shape Cards work with the Builder, the Shield system, the
Scanner, the Composer, the Projector and the Locator.

The Shape Card has a GUI on its own. Just open it and you can set the
shape. The Solid/Hollow status and a dimension and offset.

The preview of the shape you can zoom, pan, rotate using the mouse.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
The dimension is an important parameter of a shape card. Basically
the dimension of a shape card has three components: X (from west to
east), Y (from down to up), and Z (from south to north). For all uses
of a shape card the dimension defines the outer size of the shape and
what the machine will work with.

The offset also has three similar components. To best understand how
the offset works is to see what it does when all three values are at
0. In that case the area will be centered around the machine. For example,
if you have offset 0,0,0 and place the shape card in the Builder then
the Builder will work on an area with the given dimension and with the
Builder in the center of that area.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
There are three ways to set the dimension/offset of a shape card:

    First you can enter values manually.

    Secondly you can enter the dimensions only and leave offset
    alone. Then insert the shape card in the Builder and press one of the
    four 'anchor' buttons on the right to position the area.

    Finally you can sneak select the shape card on the Builder, then
    sneak select the first corner and finally sneak select the second
    corner.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
As explained above a shape card can have different shapes. For a normal
quarry you would typically use a Box shape (and preferably Solid so that
you not only quarry the outside of the box) but it is perfectly possible
to quarry in the form of a torus or a hearth. Give a bit of love to the
landscape!

There are two special shapes that are not useful directly from within the
shape card. These are 'Composition' and 'Snan'. The former is used for
shape cards that are composed in the Composer and the latter are created
by the Scanner. More on these later.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
There are a few shape card variants that are used to control what the
Builder will do with the card. There are cards to make a quarry, to pump
liquids, to place liquids, to void an area and so on. Besides having a
special function in the Builder these shape cards work just as usual and
you can use them in all the devices that work with shape cards.

A quarry shape card also has a few extra options that you can use to void
certain blocks during a quarry.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
{b}Area Scanner
{n:scanner}
{rb:scanner}

The Scanner is an advanced block that can make a scan of an area in the
world. To do this you have to insert a shape card with the appropriate
dimension and offset into the Scanner (top-left slot). The shape
(currently) does not matter. It just uses the dimension and offset.

After a scan has been made you can insert other shape cards in the bottom
slot. These shape cards will now be linked to this scan.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
It is important to realize how this linking works. Because this scanned
data is very large it is not stored in the Scanner tile entity nor in the
item. Instead it is stored in memory and saved to a folder in your
world ('rftoolsscans'). Both the scanner and the shape cards are linked
to that scan. So if you later rescan using the same scanner it will update
those shape cards as well.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
There are two other slots at the top of the Scanner. The filter slot
can contain an item filter with which you can make sure that certain blocks
are not included in the final scan. For example, you can remove all stone
from the scan that way.

The other slot is for the 'modifier'. This is a more advanced way to filter
items. With this you can also void certain blocks from the scan but you can
also replace them with other blocks.
{-------------------------------------------------------------}
